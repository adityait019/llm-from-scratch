    "This code snippet demonstrates how to remove stopwords from a text string using a function called `remove_stopwords`. First, it assigns a list of English stopwords to the variable `stopwords` by calling `stopwords.words('english')` from the NLTK library. These stopwords are common words (like \"the\", \"is\", \"and\") that are often filtered out in natural language processing tasks because they add little value to text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `remove_stopwords` function takes a string `text` as input. It splits the input text into individual words using the `split()` method, which separates the string at whitespace. For each word, the function checks if it is present in the `stopwords` list. If the word is a stopword, it is skipped using `continue`; otherwise, it is added to the `new_text` list. After processing all words, the function joins the filtered words back into a single string, separated by spaces, and returns this string. The result is the original text with all stopwords removed, making it more suitable for further text analysis or machine learning tasks."
